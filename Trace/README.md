# COMP 4490 A1 Documentation
## A1 Tasks Completed
* [x] Sphere intersection
* [x] Shadow attenuation
* [x] Distance Attenuation
* [x] multiple light sources
* [x] Texture mapping: added texture mapping support to ray tracer
* [x] phong illumination
* [ ] additional scene files

## A2 Tasks completed
- [x] Transmission and refraction
- [x] Recursive ray tracing
- [ ] Acceleration Technique:kd-tree
- [ ] Additional features
- [ ] Bump mapping (2 mks)
- [ ] anti-aliasing and DOF

## Problems
* [x] grainy rendering of images: caused by shadow casting array on the object

## other code changes
* added the mod % operator for vec3d
* added recursive raytracing
* completed sphere intersection
* completed distance and shadow attenuation
* added %= operator to vec3d
* added cross product to vec3d
* 
## TODO
* Phong illumination
* triangle intersection
* additional scene files
* KD tree
